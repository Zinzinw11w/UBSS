# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for UBSS React App

## Quick Fix Summary

Your GitHub Pages site was showing documentation instead of your React app because:

1. **Missing GitHub Pages configuration** - GitHub Pages wasn't configured to serve your React app
2. **Missing `.nojekyll` file** - GitHub Pages was trying to process files with Jekyll
3. **Missing proper routing** - Single Page App routing wasn't configured

## What We Fixed

### 1. Added GitHub Actions Workflow
Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to automatically deploy your React app when you push to main/master branch.

### 2. Updated package.json
- Added `homepage` field pointing to your GitHub Pages URL
- Added `gh-pages` package for manual deployment
- Added deployment scripts

### 3. Added Required Files
- `.nojekyll` - Tells GitHub Pages not to use Jekyll processing
- `404.html` - Handles client-side routing for React Router

## How to Deploy

### Method 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to your repository Settings → Pages
3. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
4. The workflow will automatically deploy when you push to main/master

### Method 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Method 3: Manual Upload
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Upload the entire `build` folder contents to your repository's `gh-pages` branch

## Repository Settings

In your GitHub repository:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to "GitHub Actions" (if using Method 1) or "Deploy from a branch"
3. If using branch deployment, select `gh-pages` branch and `/ (root)` folder

## Troubleshooting

### If your site still shows documentation:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check that `.nojekyll` file exists in your build directory
3. Verify the homepage URL in package.json matches your GitHub Pages URL
4. Make sure you're pushing to the correct branch (main/master)

### If assets don't load:
1. Check that the `homepage` field in package.json is correct
2. Verify all static files are in the build directory
3. Check browser console for 404 errors

## Your Site Should Now Show:
- Your React app instead of documentation
- Proper styling and functionality
- Working navigation and routing
- All assets loading correctly
